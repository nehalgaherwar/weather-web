# ⚙️ How It Works                                                  
User enters a city name                                                
JavaScript sends a request to the Weather API                                              
API returns real-time weather data                                                      
Weather details are displayed dynamically on the webpage                                                
🔑 API Setup (Important)                                                                                  
Get a free API key from:                                          

https://openweathermap.org/api (or your chosen weather API)
Open script.js and add your API key:

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
